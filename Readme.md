# UniOulu Reports

This repository is a placeholder for all the project reports submitted as part of the university of Oulu courses.


## Electronic Circuit Design Theory, Methods and Tools

A two part report about the use of SPICE Simulators and circuit simulation techniques for transient and AC sweep simulations with LT-Spice.


## Wireless Communications 1

A guided study of the different chapters of Wireless Communications 1 course using Matlab and Simulink. 

It includes:

1. Ray tracing
2. BER Analysis
3. Diversity techniques 
4. Coding Techniques


## Statistical Signal Processing 1

A study of the different estimators in the homework using Matlab codes. 

The final project was about estimation techniques.


## Electronics Design 2

A design of a Miller and a Lead compensated OPAMP using Cadence Virtuoso.


## Simulation and Tools for Telecommunications

A study of the different simulation techniques and intricacies for telecommunications systems performance.


## Radio Engineering 1

Design of an RF LNA to operate at the band of 2.0 GHz - 2.1GHz using Keysight ADS.


## Electronics Design 3

Design and layout of a current mirror OTA (operational transconductance amplifier) using Cadence Virtuoso with the generic 45nm process.
